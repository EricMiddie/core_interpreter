Files that I am submitting: 
- .venv
    this is a folder containing a python virtual environment, including the interpreter.
- tokenizer.py
    This file contains the core tokenizer and parser logic, including the main method to run the program.
- tokenTest.txt
    This file was where I was inputting my test programs to make sure that the tokenizer was working correctly.

Instructions: 

This is a python implementation of the tokenizer so a valid python interpreter is needed. To run this, I was using venv
and python version 3.11.5. I will include the .venv files in the submission so that the only thing needed is to type
"python tokenizer.py <filename>" where <filename> is replaced by whatever file you want to tokenize.

For example: python tokenizer.py tokenTest.txt

This will run the script on the test program.
